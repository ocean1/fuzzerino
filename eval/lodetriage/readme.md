##printZlibInfo_nullptrderef:
    - crash location: pngdetail.cpp:743
    - generated by:
        - lodepng-rust-698 dataset
    - root cause analysis:
        - null ptr deref > probably value of invalid block not checked by pngdetail, or failed allocation by lodepng not checked (need more in depth analysis)

##inflateHuffman_SEGV
    - generated by:
        - base-3-lodepng-rust-698
    - root cause analysis:
        - null ptr deref > inflate phase of huffman (zlib encoded) payload by lodepng, lodepng::ExtractZlib::inflateHuffmanBlock a null structure is contained in the vector, again maybe a wrong check/failed allocation, or something worse... zlibinfo->back().lz77_*.push_back(code); any of these could be failing in lodepng_util.cpp


##getTreeInflateDynamic_heapoverflow
    - generated by:
        - base-3-lodepng-rust-698
    - root cause analysis:
        - heap overflow > getTreeInflateDynamic called by inflateHuffmanBlock reads in asan memory, might be a corruption of the tree structure (or invalid pointers) and related to earier crash (inflateHuffman)

##inflateHuffmanBlock_heapoverflow
    - generated by:
        - base-3-lodepng-rust-698
    - root cause analysis:
        - might be same as earlier, but crashes with different backtrace not coming from dynamic tree inflate, but from huffmanDecode symbol (again probably broken tree structure+no checks, or again (the same?) corruption

##inflateHuffmanBlock_heapuaf
    - generated by:
        - base-3-lodepng-rust-698
    - root cause analysis:
        - might be a different bug, it's uaf, or might be that we can corrupt the tree structure enough to get a null pointer (SEGV), end up overflowing, or reusing an old chunk.

##getTreeInflateDynamic_SEGVnonzero
    - base-3-lodepng-rust-698
    - SEGV on non-zero address (weird one)
    - probably we can corrupt the struct, and make a node of the huffman tree point to somewhere (how much?)

##anotherinflate_heapoverflow
    - base-3-lodepng-rust-698
    - direct inflate heapoverflow, maybe caused by pngdetail though

##getFilterTypesInterlaced_hbof
    - base-3-lodepng-rust-698
    - base-2-pngsuite-175
    - wp(w)png --TODO check if it found two instances of bug or different ones like segv earlier by fuzzer
    - heap-buffer-overflow in interlace filters handling
